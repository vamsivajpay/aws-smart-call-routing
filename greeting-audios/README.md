# Welcome Message â€“ Statewise Audio Prompts

This folder contains pre-recorded audio greetings customized for different states. These prompts are used to welcome customers as they connect to the contact center, providing a personalized and localized experience based on the caller's region.

Each audio file is mapped to a specific state and is intended for use in the initial greeting block of your Amazon Connect contact flow. These messages help create a positive first impression and ensure customers feel recognized and supported from the beginning.

**How to Use:**
1. Upload the required audio file to Amazon Connect via **Routing > Prompts**.
2. Reference the uploaded prompt in the **Play Prompt** block at the start of your contact flow.

This ensures every customer receives a warm, region-specific welcome when they call.
